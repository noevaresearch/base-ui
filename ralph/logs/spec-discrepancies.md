## Spec Citation Discrepancies - library: form

### implementation.md citation issues:
- **Line 56**: Claims `TODO.md:407-413` has no `wraps-external:` field for the form component
  - **Actual content at TODO.md:407-413**: Avatar component (done) with exemption-from-docs-pairing note and extensive commit notes
  - **Correct location**: Form component is at TODO.md:502-508, which indeed has no `wraps-external:` field
  - **Impact**: The citation is pointing to the wrong line numbers but the actual claim (no `wraps-external:` field) is correct for the form item

### Resolution:
The citation contains correct line numbers but points to the wrong TODO.md entry. The form component at TODO.md:502-508 correctly has no `wraps-external:` field, so the spec's claim is factually correct even though the citation reference is stale. The implementation can proceed.

## Spec Citation Discrepancies - library: drawer

### behavior.md citation issues:
- **Line 393**: Claims `TODO.md:393-393` says `library: drawer` is flagged `needs-batched-mining: true`
  - **Actual content at TODO.md:393**: `- [ ] library: autocomplete`
  - **Correct location**: `needs-batched-mining: true` is at TODO.md:484 for the drawer item
  - **Impact**: The citation hash doesn't match current content

### implementation.md citation issues:
- **Lines 385-392**: Claims these contain `wraps-external:` field for drawer
  - **Actual content at TODO.md:385-392**: Alert-dialog item (done) with notes about citation drift
  - **Correct location**: Drawer item is at TODO.md:477-484, no `wraps-external:` field present
  - **Impact**: The citation hash doesn't match current content

- **Line 388**: Claims this contains precise per-unit requirements
  - **Actual content at TODO.md:388**: Note about alert-dialog citation drift resolution
  - **Correct location**: No specific per-unit requirements found at this line
  - **Impact**: The citation hash doesn't match current content

### Resolution:
These appear to be stale citations from previous iterations that weren't updated when TODO.md content changed. The drawer item at TODO.md:477-484 is correctly structured and the implementation should proceed based on the actual TODO entry, not the stale citations.

## run-regression.sh's docs-rendering gate cannot see Phase D items

- **Where**: `ralph/scripts/run-regression.sh:51-52` — step 4 keys off the item's own
  `docs-pair:` field (`get-todo-field.mjs "$TODO_ID" docs-pair`).
- **Problem**: Phase D items (`docs-content: components/*`) carry `owner: library: X` and
  **no** `docs-pair:` field (see `TODO.md`'s Phase D entries and
  `ralph/scripts/check-todo-schema.mjs`, whose pairing rule is oriented the other way:
  the *library* item points at the docs item). So for exactly the items whose `done-when`
  IS "docs-app renders <page>.mdx with all its demos using crates/leptos-ui's real
  component", the gate skips the `cargo leptos build` check entirely and passes on the
  crate tests + TODO schema alone.
- **Impact**: a Phase D item can be marked `done` with the docs-app build broken or the
  route missing. The Stage 3 prompt's own step 6 covers the gap ("it has a `docs-pair:`
  field, **or its `done-when` mentions docs-app**") — the runner does not implement the
  second half of that disjunction.
- **Not fixed here**: this iteration's item (`library: field`) does carry `docs-pair:`, so
  the gate ran the docs-app build; changing `run-regression.sh` is loop-tooling scope, not
  the item's crate. Recording it so the audit loop can align the runner with the prompt.

## `specs/library/form/implementation.md`'s TODO.md line citation has drifted out of range

- **Where**: `specs/library/form/implementation.md:56` cites "The `library: form` entry in
  `TODO.md:502-508` has no `wraps-external:` field"; the recorded baseline key is
  `TODO.md:407-413` (`specs/library/form/implementation.citations.json:52`).
- **Problem**: the assertion itself still holds — the `library: form` entry carries no
  `wraps-external:` field — but the entry has moved far from both cited ranges: it now
  lives at `TODO.md:619-643` (the file grew as entry notes accumulated above it).
- **Impact**: none for this iteration's work: the citation checker's shift tolerance
  reports it rather than blocking, and neither cited range (`407-413`, `502-508`) falls
  inside the window this iteration's `blocked-by`/`note` edit touched, so no baseline was
  invalidated. Recording it so the audit loop can re-anchor the range to the entry's true
  position (the `context-menu`/`accordion` re-anchoring precedent) instead of this
  iteration rewriting a spec citation — the specs are not mine to silently "fix".

# Appended by the `docs-content: components/field` iteration.

## The port's `Field.Error` stays MOUNTED (marked `hidden`) while upstream renders `null`

- **Where**: `crates/leptos-ui/src/field/field_parts.rs:600-668` (`field_error_view`) vs
  `packages/react/src/field/error/FieldError.tsx:128-134`.
- **Observed** (real browser, mounting the docs page's hero demo — the pristine, untouched
  state, `crates/docs-app/src/render_test.rs::field_hero_demo_renders_the_real_part_composition`):
  the rendered tree contains
  `<div class="text-sm text-red-700 dark:text-red-400" id="base-ui-4" hidden="">Please enter your name</div>`
  alongside the label/control/description. Upstream returns `null` when `!mounted`
  (`FieldError.tsx:130-134`), and `useTransitionStatus(rendered)` seeds `mounted` from
  `rendered` — so the React DOM has NO error element at all before validation surfaces.
  The port instead always renders the `<div>`, gating visibility on
  `hidden=move || (!status.mounted()).then(|| "".to_string())` (`field_parts.rs:625`) and
  rendering the user's `children` OUTSIDE the mounted gate (`:667`; only the derived-message
  arm is gated, `:627-666`).
- **Impact**: a pristine field's `innerHTML` carries the error message text where upstream's
  does not (visually identical — `hidden` — but not DOM-identical, which is what the docs-page
  differential tests compare). Related: the message-id registration is a body-time
  unconditional push (`field_parts.rs:505`) while upstream registers inside a
  `rendered`-gated layout effect with a clear-on-unrender teardown
  (`FieldError.tsx:64-78`) — whether that reaches `aria-describedby` on the control (the
  pristine DOM shows the control with `aria-labelledby` only, no `aria-describedby` at all)
  needs its own verification; recorded, not claimed.
- **Not fixed here**: this iteration's item is `docs-content: components/field` (crate
  `docs-app`); `crates/leptos-ui` belongs to the `library: field` item, whose own suite is
  green at the done-marked tree. The docs page pins the port's ACTUAL contract (mounted +
  `hidden`) and cross-references this entry, rather than asserting an upstream DOM shape the
  port does not produce and calling the page verified. Recording it so the audit loop (or a
  `library: field` reopen) can decide whether the unmount arm is a real parity gap.

## `specs/docs-content/field/demos.json` over-claims the hero demo's error trigger

- **Where**: `specs/docs-content/field/demos.json`, the hero entry's
  `nonTrivialInteractions[1]`: "Field.Error renders only when the native
  valueMissing constraint matches (empty required input), surfacing once validation is
  triggered per Field.Root's default onBlur validation mode".
- **Problem (two claims, both contradicted by upstream source)**: (1) Field.Root's
  default validation mode is **`'onSubmit'`**, not `onBlur`
  (`packages/react/src/internals/form-context/FormContext.ts:42`,
  `packages/react/src/internals/field-root-context/FieldRootContext.ts:48`). (2) Nothing in
  the demo triggers validation at all: the demo (`demos/hero/tailwind/index.tsx:1-21`) has no
  `<Form>` and no submit control, and with `validationMode === 'onSubmit'` +
  `submitCountRef.current === 0` the change path takes the revalidate early-return
  (`packages/react/src/field/root/useFieldValidation.ts:244-246` — `if (revalidate) { if
  (state.valid !== false || !element) return; … }`, and the pristine state's `valid` is
  `null`, never `false`). Upstream's OWN FieldError tests drive the error through a `<Form>`
  + `<button type="submit">`: `FieldError.test.tsx:32-53` asserts the message is absent after
  focus + two `change`s + blur, and only appears after the submit click; the `match="valueMissing"`
  test (`:56-79`) shows the same submit-first ordering, then a change to `''` keeps it visible
  *because the submit already committed `state.valid === false`*.
- **Impact**: a docs-app iteration that trusts this line will pin the wrong behavior — the
  field page's wasm tests first asserted "blur surfaces the error" (failed: blur only commits
  under `onBlur` mode, `field_control.rs:403`) and then "type-then-clear surfaces the error"
  (also failed: the revalidate early-return above). The page now pins the upstream-true
  behavior — the slot stays hidden in this demo — and cites this entry.
- **Not fixed here**: `specs/**` is not the iteration's to rewrite. The demo JSON's prose is a
  Stage-2 mining over-claim about a trigger; the demo source and the port agree.

## behavior.md's Enter `defaultPrevented` observable is a React-synthetic artifact

- **Where**: `specs/library/checkbox/behavior.md` → "Keyboard interactions": "at the time
  the ancestor handler runs, `event.defaultPrevented` is still `false`, proving Root does not
  itself `preventDefault()` on Enter (`packages/react/src/checkbox/root/CheckboxRoot.test.tsx:849-852`, `:871`)".
- **Problem**: the claim holds upstream but is a property of **React's synthetic event**, not
  of the DOM. `packages/react/src/checkbox/root/CheckboxRoot.tsx:354` calls
  `originalNativePreventDefault.call(nativeEvent)` — the NATIVE event IS cancelled, and that
  cancellation is precisely how native button activation is suppressed. An ancestor handler
  observes `false` only because React stamps the native event's members onto a fresh synthetic
  object when that object is created (before Root's handler runs), so Root's later native
  `preventDefault()` cannot retroactively update the copy. A native-DOM port has exactly one
  event object per dispatch, so an ancestor there observes the real (cancelled) flag.
- **Impact**: the port's `on_key_down` mirrors upstream's two-phase dance
  (`crates/leptos-ui/src/checkbox/root.rs:931-1052`): it installs a `preventDefault` recorder
  (so a consumer/ancestor `preventDefault()` during propagation suppresses the Enter-submit),
  cancels the native event, and restores the originals one microtask later. Its
  `defaultPrevented` *accessor* installation is **dead code**: it reads
  `Reflect::get(event, "defaultPrevented")` and requires the value to cast to
  `js_sys::Function`, but `defaultPrevented` is a boolean — so the branch that would have
  shadowed the property (emulating React's synthetic flag) never runs. The port's wasm test
  now pins the port's REAL contract (native event cancelled, no toggle, no
  `onCheckedChange`) rather than asserting a synthetic layer the port does not have.
- **Not fixed here**: whether a native-DOM port *should* emulate React's synthetic
  `defaultPrevented` (shadow the property with an accessor, then restore the original
  descriptor a microtask later) is a design question for the audit loop, not an iteration's
  call. The port's observable Enter behavior — never toggles, and a consumer/ancestor opt-out
  still suppresses submission — matches upstream either way. `specs/**` is not this
  iteration's to rewrite.
